## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

• Python

• A text editor e.g. Sublime or Atom

• A terminal application

## There are 6 relevant columns in this dataset, which are:
 
• URL: is the link to the rental expose. You can have a look at the flat!

• Region: is the Berlin district, where the flat is located

• Condition: is the condition of the flat

• Rooms: The number of rooms the flat has

• Rent: Monthly rent for the flat

• Year_Construction: The year in which the house was build

• Space: How many square meters does the flat has?

## Let us start by asking questions we might want to understand the Immobilien scout data and to make smarter business decisions Questions such as;

• How many different Regions are there?

• What is the maximum rent? What is the minimum rent?

• What is on average the most expensive region and at what size?

• What is the mean rent for the different room sizes and per condition?

• Which region has the best price per square meter?
